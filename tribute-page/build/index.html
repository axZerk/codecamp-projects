          <p>Conqueror and king of Macedonia, Alexander the Great was born on July 20, 356 B.C., in Pella, in the
            Ancient Greek kingdom of Macedonia. During his leadership, from 336 to 323 B.C., he united the Greek
            city-states and led the Corinthian League. He
            also became the king of Persia, Babylon and Asia, and created Macedonian colonies in the region. While
            considering the conquests of Carthage and Rome, Alexander died of malaria in Babylon (now Iraq), on June 13,
            323 B.C.
            <br/> Cavalry commander at age eighteen, king at twenty, conqueror of the Persian Empire at twenty-six,
            explorer of the Indian frontier at thirty. Alexander’s conquests created a legend that would provide the
            standard by which other leaders
            measured their careers.
            <br/> Although we lack sufficient details about his character, there was no doubt that he was an
            inspiring leader and personally a very brave soldier. He was ruthless toward those who opposed him—even from
            within his own ranks—but fair and
            honest toward those who exhibited courage and skill.</p>

              <h2 class="content-article__title">Early Life</h2>
              <p>Alexander the Great was born in the Pella region of the Ancient Greek kingdom of Macedonia on July 20,
                356 B.C., to parents King Philip II of Macedon and Queen Olympia, daughter of King Neoptolemus.
                Alexander received his earliest education under
                the tutelage of his relative, the stern Leonidas of Epirus. Leonidas, who had been hired by King Phillip
                to teach Alexander math, horsemanship and archery, struggled to control his rebellious student. In 343
                B.C., King Philip II hired the philosopher
                Aristotle to tutor Alexander at the Temple of the Nymphs at Meiza. Over the course of three years,
                Aristotle taught Alexander and a handful of his friends philosophy, poetry, drama, science and
                politics.</p>

              <p>In 336, Alexander's sister wed the Molossian king, an uncle who was also called Alexander. During the
                festival that followed, King Philip II was murdered at the hands of Pausanias, a Macedonian noble. In
                the wake of his father's death, Alexander,
                then 19, was determined to seize the throne by any means necessary. He quickly garnered the support of
                the Macedonian army, including the general and troops he had fought with at Chaeronea.</p>

          <h2 class="content-article__title">Campaigns and Conquests</h2>
          <p>As Alexander was nearing the end of his northern campaign, he was delivered the news that Thebes, a Greek
            city-state, had forced out the Macedonian troops that were garrisoned there. Fearing a revolt among the
            other city-states, Alexander leapt into
            action, marching his massive army—consisting of 3,000 cavalry and 30,000 infantry—southward all the way to
            the tip of the Greek peninsula. Meanwhile, Alexander's general, Parmenion, had already made his way to Asia
            Minor. Alexander and his forces
            arrived in Thebes so quickly that the city-state didn't have a chance to pull together allies for its
            defense. Three days after his arrival, Alexander led the massacre of Thebes. It was Alexander's hope that
            the destruction of Thebes would serve
            as a warning to city-states contemplating revolt. His intimidation tactic proved effective; the other Greek
            city-states, including Athens, chose to pledge their alliance to the Macedonian Empire or opted to remain
            neutral. In 334, Alexander embarked
            on his Asiatic expedition, arriving in Troy that spring. Alexander then faced Persian King Darius III's army
            near the Grancius River; Darius' forces were swiftly defeated. By fall, Alexander and his army had made it
            across the southern coast of
            Asia Minor to Gordium, where they took the winter to rest. In the summer of 333, the troops of Alexander and
            Darius once again went head to head in battle at Issus. Although Alexander's army was outnumbered, he used
            his flair for military strategy
            to create formations that defeated the Persians again and caused Darius to flee. In November of 333,
            Alexander declared himself the king of Persia after capturing Darius and making him a fugitive. Next up on
            Alexander's agenda was his campaign to
            conquer Egypt. After besieging Gaza on his way to Egypt, Alexander easily achieved his conquest; Egypt fell
            without resistance. In 331, he created the city of Alexandria, designed as a hub for Greek culture and
            commerce. Later that year, Alexander
            defeated the Persians at the Battle of Gaugamela. With the collapse of the Persian army, Alexander became
            "King of Babylon, King of Asia, King of the Four Quarters of the World." Alexander's next conquest was
            eastern Iran, where he created Macedonian
            colonies and in 327 seized the fortress in Ariamazes. After capturing Prince Oxyartes, Alexander married the
            prince's daughter, Rhoxana. In 328, Alexander defeated King Porus' armies in northern India. Finding himself
            impressed by Porus, Alexander
            reinstated him as king and won his loyalty and forgiveness. Alexander forged eastward to the Ganges but
            headed back when his armies refused to advance any farther. On their way back along the Indus, Alexander was
            wounded by Malli warriors. In 325,
            after Alexander had recovered, he and his army headed north along the rugged Persian Gulf, where many fell
            prey to illness, injury and death. In February 324, Alexander at last reached the city of Susa. Desperate to
            retain his leadership and recruit
            more soldiers, he tried to connect Persian nobles to Macedonians in order to create a ruling class. To this
            end, at Susa he commanded that a large number of Macedonians marry Persian princesses. After Alexander
            managed to recruit tens of thousands
            of Persian soldiers into his army, he dismissed many of his existing Macedonian soldiers. This enraged the
            soldiers, who spoke critically of Alexander's new troops and condemned him for adopting Persian customs and
            manners. Alexander appeased the
            Macedonian soldiers by killing 13 Persian military leaders. The Thanksgiving Feast at Susa, which had been
            geared towards solidifying the bond between Persians and Macedonians, shaped up to be quite the
            opposite.</p>

          <h2 class="content-article__title">Death</h2>
          <p>While considering the conquests of Carthage and Rome, Alexander the Great died of malaria in Babylon (now
            Iraq), on June 13, 323 B.C. He was just 32 years old. Rhoxana gave birth to his son a few months later.
            After Alexander died, his empire collapsed
            and the nations within it battled for power. Over time, the cultures of Greece and the Orient synthesized
            and thrived as a side effect of Alexander's empire, becoming part of his legacy and spreading the spirit of
            Panhellenism.</p>
