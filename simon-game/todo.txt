User Story: I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the
 series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.

User Story: I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong,
 it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.

User Story: I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct.
 I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.

Hint: Here are mp3s you can use for each button:
